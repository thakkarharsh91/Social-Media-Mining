# Social-Media-Mining

The project focused on the two main aspects as under :
1. Given two social networks (Google Plus and Twitter) and a particular user in one network (Google Plus), find the top most similar users in the other network (Twitter).
2. Given two social networks (Google Plus and Twitter) and a particular user u in one network (Google Plus) and the given top similar users to user u in other network (twitter), find top p recommended users to user u based on these top k users.

The project is a web based application based on the concepts of the Jsp, Servelet, Javascript, JQuery and J2SE.

The project was basically developed on the concepts of below algorithms :
1. PageRank and
2. HITS algorithm

The results from these two algorithms were used for construction of Bipartite graphs which were further used for the calculation of similarity matrix.

For the working of the algorithm, the csv files are taken as input which is based on the data of two social networks (google plus and twitter). The same files are generated based on matlab codes.
Once the program runs, the user needs to give the parameters as displayed in the front page and after the successfull execution of the program, the output file is generated in C:\Users\Username folder.
